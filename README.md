<h2> <img src = "Images/Project Description.png" width = "25" align = "center"> Project Description </h2>
</a>

In this project, we are trying to make our own version of the mobile game **Bouncing Balls** using the power of **Procedural Programming** and **C++**.

> This game is **not** developed using the ***Object Oriented*** programming paradigm, eventhough **C++** is capable of it.

As for the graphics, we used **SDL** as a software platform designed to handle Geometric Shapes, Images, Fonts, Audios, etc.

Data is also handled using **Plain Text File**s. There are 2 seperate text files for the setting and the users data to be stored.

> The balls that are not connected to the main network are dropped using a pretty simple ***Path Finding Algorithm***, in fact, all the balls connected to the main network of balls are detected by finding paths of balls from the "walls" to the network, and the remaining balls are dropped.
